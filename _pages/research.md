Posets and Causal Set Theory
======

The Causal Set Theory approach to Quantum Gravity posits that spacetime is fundamentally a locally finite partially ordered set (poset).  This physical motivation for studying posets raises many interesting questions about posets of a purely mathematical nature.  I'm interested in questions of this kind, whether for their application to physics or not.

Anything interesting
======

My interests are quite broad, so I'm probably thinking about other things not listed here.
