Music
======

Music is a big part of my life, whether it be listening, playing or writing.  Lately, I've been trying to experience more live music.  My live music bucket list includes [Bon Iver](https://boniver.org/){:target="_blank"}, Schnittke's Choir Concerto, and Mahler's 2<sup>nd</sup> Symphony, *The Resurrection.*

You can [listen](https://icgeorge.bandcamp.com/){:target="_blank"} to some of the music I've written.
